            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Cosmos</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cosmos often simply means "universe". But the word is generally used to suggest an
                orderly or harmonious universe, as it was originally used by Pythagoras in the 6th century B.C. Thus, a
                religious mystic may help put us in touch with the cosmos, and so may a physicist. The same is often
                true of the adjective cosmic: Cosmic rays (really particles rather than rays) bombard us from outer
                space, but cosmic questions come from human attempts to find order in the universe.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. According to this theory, space and time emerged together 13.787Â±0.020 billion years ago, and the universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Time travel is the hypothetical activity of traveling into the past or future. Time travel is a widely recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, particularly science fiction. In fiction, time travel is typically achieved through the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it, such as a rotating black hole. Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in theoretical physics, and is usually connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes.</p>
